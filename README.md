Pinelands Music School Web Development Log:

28/03 - Tim- Created the index folder for the site.

22/03 - Tim - Ive quickly done a mockup on all the public 		pages (home, about, contact, login, register), which are in my folder. Obviously 	the colours/font/feel of the design will change, but you 	guys should get the gist of the layout. Basically a 	header, and a footer with all content contained in a 	coloured box.  
	Within my folder I have also included a first mockup of 	the website flow diagram. In total the site will have ~23 	pages. I wouldnt be surprised if it changed though.  
	So lastly, if we could allocate some workload, as we need 	a high and low fidelity mockups which is like 50 mockups 	of pages, would be good.  
	I'll do both low and high fidelity mock ups of all the 	student pages. That leaves the Admin and Teacher pages, 	for you guys.  
	I'm using moqups.com. I can give you access to my files 	that you can build on, just let me know if you want to because I have to manually add you to the project.
